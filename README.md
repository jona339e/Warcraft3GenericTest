# Warcraft3GenericTest
Just a test for creating a generic web-api

Using a simple repository pattern and a local SQL database.


To create a faction you can use this json format:

{
  "entity": {
    "name": "{Faction Name}"
  }
}


Since there are many to many to ...

the dto looks like a lot but it is handled so you only need to create a name for the entity.
